# React Performance Practice Projects

Welcome to the **React Performance Practice Projects** repository.  
This repo contains multiple small to mid-sized React applications focused on exploring and applying various performance optimization techniques and best practices.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this repository is to **practice and demonstrate performance improvements in React applications**, including (but not limited to):

- Code splitting
- Memoization strategies (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`)
- Lazy loading components and assets
- Optimizing context usage
- Avoiding unnecessary re-renders
- Virtualization techniques
- Efficient state management
- Debouncing and throttling
- Performance profiling with React DevTools

Each folder within this repository represents a **self-contained project or demo**, each targeting a specific performance concept or strategy.
